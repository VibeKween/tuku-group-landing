## About TUKU GROUP

TUKU GROUP is an independent creative house based in New York. Our ethos: "Craft over noise. Fewer, better, slower."

We make real what we believe in and work alongside brands that share our ethos. We partner with ventures that matter - founder-led businesses ready for intentional growth.

## Methodologies

### Language Excavation
Our signature discovery process. We excavate founder language across domains to surface authentic pillars - what teams actually believe, not what industry language suggests.
