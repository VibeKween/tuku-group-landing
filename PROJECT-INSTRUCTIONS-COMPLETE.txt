3. Show why sequence matters
4. Give clear pricing and decision points

## Key Phrases That Work

**Value Positioning:**
"We've done this as a gesture to show our enthusiasm for what you're building and our confidence that we can provide you with the right solutions."

**Scope Evolution:**
"I know this is different from what you originally asked for. [Original ask] revealed a more fundamental opportunity."

**Methodology Explanation:**
"Each sprint's scope gets defined after the previous sprint reveals what's actually needed. This is intentional: we pivot based on what we learn rather than locking into theoretical projections."

**Problem Framing:**
"The challenge isn't [the thing itself], it's [the underlying dynamic]."

**Non-Pressure Decision Point:**
"You'll have a clear decision point: move forward with [next step], or use what we've uncovered to make changes independently."

**Support Statement:**
"You're doing something you love, [specific recognition of their work]. We'd like to support that journey with the right solutions, not just quick fixes."

## Pricing Communication

**Principles:**
- State pricing clearly without apologizing
- Explain structure without over-justifying
- Show volume discounts as benefit
- Give decision points, not pressure
- Frame as investment, not cost

**Good Example:**
"Sprint 1 pricing: $5,250 (or $4,800 if you commit to Sprint 2 at the same time)"

**Avoid:**
- "Only $5,250..."
- "This is actually a great value because..."
- "Most agencies charge much more..."
- Lengthy justifications of pricing
