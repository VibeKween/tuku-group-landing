# TUKU GROUP PRICING 2025

## Engagement Philosophy
"We build ideas that feel worth making. Each engagement follows a deliberate structure: understand first, build with intention, ship complete. Pricing reflects the care required to do this well."

## Engagement Options

### New Client Discovery
**$5,000**
*Clarity before execution.*

Discovery is where we determine what you're actually building. Not just the features or deliverables, but what the work is for, what it should feel like, what success looks like when it's live.

We map the vision, identify what matters, and define the thing itself. By the end, the idea has shape and direction. You know what you want to see, what you want to interact with, what's worth making.

This clarity gives purpose to everything that follows. Sprints can work with focus because discovery established where we're going.

### Sprint Build
**$5,250**
*Build with intention. Ship complete.*

Two weeks of focused execution on a single milestone. Each sprint delivers something complete: brand, design, or platform. Scoped, executed, delivered.

Multi-sprint projects can be planned in sequence. Pricing scales with scope:
- Additional sprints (when booked together): $4,800 each
- Three or more sprints: $4,500 per sprint
- One sprint at a time. When yours begins, you have our full attention.

### Retainer Engagement
**$1,500/mo**
*Strategic support. Thoughtful refinement.*

Ongoing guidance once the work is live. For projects that continue to evolve: small refinements, strategic direction, ongoing care.

Available after completing sprint work together.

### Entry Point for New Clients
**$10,250**
*Discovery + First Sprint*

## Payment Terms

### Payment Structure
The work requires focus. Payment timing ensures we can dedicate attention without distraction while creating natural milestones that confirm value as the project progresses.

The final payment arrives when the work is complete and live. This moment confirms what was built and often becomes the conversation about what's next.

### Payment Details

**Discovery**
- Full payment due before work begins.

**Sprint Build (Single Sprint)**
- 50% to begin, 50% upon completion.

**Multi-Sprint Projects**
Volume pricing ($4,800 or $4,500 per sprint) requires upfront commitment to the full series.

Payment schedule:
- 50% deposit before first sprint begins
- 25% at midpoint (when Sprint 2 begins for 2-3 sprint projects, Sprint 2 or 3 for larger projects)
- 25% upon final completion

Example: Three-sprint project ($13,500 total)
- $6,750 upfront
- $3,375 when Sprint 2 begins
- $3,375 upon completion

### Additional Terms

**Retainer Engagements**
- Billed monthly in advance on the 1st of each month. Auto-payment preferred.

**Scope Changes**
- Work outside defined sprint scope is billed at $200/hour. Invoiced upon completion, due within 7 days.

**Cancellation Policy**
- Discovery is non-refundable once work begins. Sprint work can be paused or rescheduled with 10 business days notice. Retainers require 30 days written notice for cancellation.

## How We Work

### Sprint Scope Lock
Each sprint is scoped before it begins. Once a sprint starts, the scope is locked. Minor refinements within the sprint's intent are included.

Significant additions or changes require either:
- **Sprint extension** - Billed at $200/hour for additional time required
- **New sprint** - Added to the project roadmap

The premium hourly rate for mid-sprint changes ensures we maintain focus on delivering what was scoped. When work is planned as part of the roadmap, you benefit from sprint pricing. When it's added mid-stream, the higher rate reflects the disruption to planned execution.

### Change Management

**Discovery Changes**
- If project direction changes during discovery, we adjust the roadmap before sprint work begins. You'll see the revised scope and timeline before proceeding.

**Between Sprint Changes**
- Adjustments between sprints are expected. We refine the plan based on what we learned. The next sprint's scope is defined before it begins.
