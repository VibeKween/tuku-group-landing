## Payment Restoration Steps

### When Ready to Implement Server-Side Payment:

1. **Choose Hosting Platform with Server Support:**
   - Vercel (recommended)
   - Netlify Functions 
   - Railway
   - Traditional VPS

2. **Restore Removed HTML Sections:**
   - Add back customer information form
   - Restore payment processing section
   - Implement success/confirmation flow

3. **Update JavaScript Logic:**
   - Restore form validation (`payment.js`)
   - Implement Stripe payment processing
   - Add step navigation between service → info → payment → success

4. **Server-Side Components:**
   - Payment intent creation endpoint
   - Webhook handling for payment confirmation
   - Email notifications
   - Receipt generation

5. **Update GA4 Events:**
   - Change `schedule_project` back to `payment_initiated`
   - Add payment success tracking
   - Restore multi-step funnel analytics

## File References
- **Original payment.js**: Contains all form logic and Stripe integration
- **Original payment.css**: Has all payment form styling preserved
- **services.json**: Service definitions and pricing intact
- **Stripe configuration**: Webhook endpoints and API keys needed

## Service Selection Logic (Preserved)
The core service selection functionality remains intact:
- Dynamic service loading from `config/services.json`
- Service package click tracking
- Price calculation and display
- All GA4 service selection events

## Notes
- All styling in `payment.css` preserved for easy restoration
- Service definitions in JSON format ready for payment integration
- GA4 tracking infrastructure ready for conversion funnel restoration
- Email subjects and branding maintained for consistency

**Restoration Estimate**: 2-3 hours development time once hosting platform selected.
