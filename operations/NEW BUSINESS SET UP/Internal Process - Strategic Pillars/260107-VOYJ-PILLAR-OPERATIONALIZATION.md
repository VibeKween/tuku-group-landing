## PILLAR DEFINITIONS

### NUCLEUS (The Anchor)
**Type**: Identity (What we ARE)
**Decision Test**: "Does this strengthen our gravitational pull?"
**Statement**: The center everything radiates from.

**Supporting Evidence**:
> "The hotel is a nucleus in a community, moving people into it. And also drawing people from the community... creating a beautiful story of what all of that is." — KYLIE (Quote 372)

---

### CONSIDERED
**Type**: Operations (How we OPERATE)
**Decision Test**: "Did a human make this call with care?"
**Statement**: The human hand in every decision.

**Supporting Evidence**:
> "Vetted. Stamp of approval. Not letting everyone in." — MARTY
> "I wouldn't feel comfortable telling them Xena's on Amazon... felt tacky and cheap." — SARA
> "Little touches that show you've actually stayed there, taken the time to think." — KYLIE

---

### PRESENT
**Type**: Engagement (How we SHOW UP)
**Decision Test**: "Are we actually there?"
**Statement**: On-site and attentive.

**Supporting Evidence**:
> "We're there, we're managing the property, we're on site with you—not just opening the door, making sure it's clean, and letting you check in." — MARTY (Quote 663)
> "That human touch. We're not just some monolithic tech platform." — MARTY (Quote 614)
> "Hospitality is such a personal, human thing." — SARA (Quote 484)
> "The need for that human connection point and touch point." — KYLIE (Quote 383)

---

### SEEN
**Type**: Outcome (What we CREATE)
**Decision Test**: "Will the guest feel recognized?"
**Statement**: Recognized, not processed.

**Supporting Evidence**:
> "I want them to feel good about themselves, that they felt important and seen and heard." — KYLIE (Quote 393)
> "Made me feel awesome. Good energy. The feeling you get when you walk in." — SARA (Quote 584)
> "We don't want anyone to feel little. We want them to feel big and bright." — KYLIE (Quote 376)

## FOUNDER ALIGNMENT SUMMARY

| Founder | Primary Pillar | Secondary Pillar | Role |
|---------|---------------|------------------|------|
| **Pat** | NUCLEUS | CONSIDERED | Vision, property strategy, overall direction |
| **Marty** | CONSIDERED | NUCLEUS | Investment discipline, financial guardrails |
| **Sara** | PRESENT | SEEN | On-site operations, quality standards, team |
| **Kylie** | SEEN | PRESENT | Brand expression, guest recognition, community |

---

## GAP ANALYSIS

### Pillar Coverage

| Pillar | Project Count | Founder Coverage | Assessment |
|--------|---------------|------------------|------------|
| NUCLEUS | 10 | Pat, Sara, Marty, Kylie | ✅ Strong |
| CONSIDERED | 10 | Marty, Sara, Kylie, Pat | ✅ Strong |
| PRESENT | 12 | Sara (primary), Kylie | ⚠️ Sara-heavy |
| SEEN | 11 | Kylie (primary), Sara | ⚠️ Kylie-heavy |

### Observations

1. **PRESENT is Sara-dependent**: Nearly all "showing up" work flows through Sara. Risk if Sara is unavailable.

2. **SEEN is Kylie-dependent**: Brand expression and guest recognition concentrated in one person.

3. **Pat is strategy-focused**: Little involvement in day-to-day pillar execution. By design?

4. **Marty is appropriately distant**: Financial oversight role doesn't require operational presence.

### Questions for Facilitation

1. Is the Sara/Kylie concentration intentional, or a scaling risk?
2. What PRESENT capabilities need backup/redundancy?
3. How does technology eventually support (not replace) PRESENT and SEEN?

---

## DECISION FILTER APPLICATION

### Example: New Property Opportunity

| Pillar | Question | Pass/Fail Test |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| NUCLEUS | Does this strengthen our gravitational pull? | Does it have anchor potential, or is it satellite only? |
| CONSIDERED | Did a human evaluate this with care? | Have we visited, vetted vendors, understood the community? |
| PRESENT | Can we actually be there? | Is the geography manageable? Can we staff it? |
| SEEN | Will guests feel recognized? | Can we implement our touchpoint standards at this property? |

### Example: Technology Investment

| Pillar | Question | Pass/Fail Test |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| NUCLEUS | Does this strengthen our gravitational pull? | Does it connect guests to place, or abstract them from it? |
| CONSIDERED | Did a human evaluate this with care? | Are we building vs. buying with intention? |
| PRESENT | Does this support (not replace) human presence? | Does it free staff time for guests, or remove staff from interaction? |
| SEEN | Will guests feel more recognized? | Does it enable personalization, or standardize experience? |

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Validate PRESENT**: Confirm this is the right fourth pillar word (alternatives: Rooted, Embedded, Attentive)

2. **Verify Project Mapping**: Cross-check that listed projects are accurate and current

3. **Identify Gaps**: What capabilities have no projects? What pillars are under-resourced?

4. **Create Slide**: Choose Option A, B, or C (or combination) for facilitation deck

5. **Facilitation Sequence**: 
   - Present three original pillars first
   - Introduce PRESENT as fourth
   - Show how current work ladders to pillars
   - Invite validation/refinement
