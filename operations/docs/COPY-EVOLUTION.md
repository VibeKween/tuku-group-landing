# Copy Evolution - Tuku Group Landing Page

## Version History & Rationale

### Hero Statement Evolution

**Original PDR Copy:**
```
Independent ideas. Thoughtful brands. Built with intention.
```

**Final Copy:**
```
Independent ideas. Thoughtful brands. Assembled with intention.
```

**Rationale**: "Assembled" feels softer and more thoughtful than "built" - aligns better with craft-focused brand voice.

### About Section Evolution

**Original PDR Copy:**
```
A creative house dedicated to cultivating independent ideas and building thoughtful brands.
We operate as both a parent and a partner: holding ventures we believe in and supporting small, emerging labels that align with our ethos.
```

**Interim Copy:**
```
A creative house for ventures that matter.
We build what we believe in and guide brands that share our ethos.
```

**Final Copy:**
```
A creative house for ventures that matter.
We hold what we believe in and guide brands that share our ethos.
```

**Rationale**: 
- Removed "parent and partner" language (too confusing)
- "Ventures that matter" is more concise and impactful
- "Hold" instead of "build" maintains consistency with softer tone
- Eliminated redundancy about "independent ideas and thoughtful brands"

---

### Work Section Evolution

**Original PDR Copy:**
```
Tuku Group builds and sustains ventures with cultural relevance.
We selectively provide guidance to small brands, helping clarify vision, refine execution, and create resonance without noise.
```

**Final Copy:**
```
We selectively provide guidance to emerging labels, helping clarify vision, refine execution, and create resonance.
```

**Rationale**:
- Removed redundant "Tuku Group builds and sustains ventures" (already covered)
- "Emerging labels" instead of "small brands" for variety and precision
- Removed "without noise" (already established in philosophy section)
- Cleaner, less repetitive flow

---

### Philosophy Section (No Changes)

**Maintained Original:**
```
Craft over noise. Fewer, better, slower.
Culture as compass. Present-tense signals, designed to endure.
Independent by choice. Decentralized thinking, sovereign in approach.
```

**Rationale**: Core philosophy was perfect as written - foundational to brand voice.

### Footer Evolution

**Original PDR Copy:**
```
© Tuku Group. Independent and privately held.
Brand IP and imagery used under license by their respective entities.
[contact@tukugroup.com]
```

**Final Copy:**
```
© 2025 Tuku Group, LLC. Independent and privately held.
```

**Rationale**:
- Added 2025 for currency
- Added "LLC" for legal accuracy
- Removed IP disclaimer (unnecessary for minimal site)
- Contact moved to dedicated section above

---

### Email Integration Enhancement

**Added Feature:**
```
mailto:contact@tukugroup.com?subject=Start%20a%20conversation%20—%20Tuku%20Group
```

**Rationale**: Branded subject line that matches manifesto tone while remaining professional.

### Payment Portal Service Naming Evolution (November 2025)

**Service Model Update:**
```
OLD: Discovery ($1,200) → Sprint ($4,500) → Retainer ($1,500)
NEW: Clarity Sprint ($5,250) → Technical Build ($12,500) → Multi-Phase Build (Scoped)
```

**Key Service Name Change:**
```
"Light Package" → "CLARITY SPRINT"
```

**Rationale**: 
- "Light Package" unintentionally suggested less value/importance
- "CLARITY SPRINT" emphasizes valuable outcome (clarity) and action-oriented approach
- Aligns with TUKU's strategic, focused brand voice
- Better communicates the engagement's purpose as strategic exploration

**Additional Updates:**
- All service names made slightly bolder (font-weight: 500)
- Service descriptions refined for better hierarchy
- Structured data updated to reflect new naming

## Words to Avoid (Comprehensive)

### TUKU-Specific Learned Avoidances
- **"Build"** (too generic, harsh) → Use "craft," "assemble," "hold"
- **"Parent/child"** language → Confusing in business context
- **Repetitive "noise"** references → Establish once, don't repeat

### Master Voice Spec Banned Words/Phrases
- **realm, delve, vast landscape, shaping the future, journey, akin, equitable, contribute, welcome, today, we'll unpack, paradigm shift, paving the way, navigate/navigating**
- **Overhype, breathless futurism, smug minimalism, dystopian/utopian declarations**
- **Negative framing as default** (avoid "not," "don't," "isn't")
- **Woo, sci-fi tones, or vague metaphor chains**
- **Gendered or stereotypical anecdotes**
- **Corporate jargon** → Keep language authentic and direct

---
