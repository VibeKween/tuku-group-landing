# Pillar Discovery Methodology
## A TUKU Group Framework for Strategic Identity Work

**Client:** Voyj  
**Engagement:** Discovery Phase (November 2025 - January 2026)  
**Document ID:** TUKU-METHOD-VOYJ-260108  
**Created:** January 2026

---

## Executive Summary

This document captures the complete methodology, artifacts, and best practices from the Voyj Pillar Discovery engagement. The work produced two primary deliverables: a 34-slide PowerPoint presentation for team facilitation and an interactive HTML decision filter tool for ongoing operational use. Both artifacts emerged from systematic analysis of 689 verbatim quotes across 12 founder sessions.

The methodology described here is replicable for future identity work with founder-led businesses.

## Part 1: The Engagement Architecture

### 1.1 Engagement Overview

| Dimension | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Duration** | 8 weeks (Nov 2025 - Jan 2026) |
| **Sessions** | 12 discovery sessions |
| **Participants** | 4 founders (Pat, Marty, Sara, Kylie) |
| **Raw Material** | 500+ minutes of conversation |
| **Quote Corpus** | 689 verbatim quotes |
| **Domains Explored** | 8 strategic domains |
| **Artifacts Produced** | 2 (PowerPoint deck, Interactive HTML tool) |

### 1.2 The Core Question

The engagement began with a single question: **"Who is Voyj?"**

This question proved more complex than expected because:
- Founders used industry-standard language that didn't capture their actual convictions
- Apparent consensus masked meaningful divergences
- The team needed alignment before external brand work could proceed

### 1.3 Methodology Selection

We employed **Language Excavation** rather than traditional brand workshops.

**Traditional Approach:**
- Consultant introduces frameworks
- Team selects from options
- Language is prescribed

**Language Excavation Approach:**
- Sessions capture verbatim language
- Analysis surfaces patterns across speakers
- Pillars emerge from authentic vocabulary
- Team validates rather than creates

---

## Part 2: The Process

### 2.1 Phase 1: Raw Capture (Weeks 1-4)

**Objective:** Accumulate verbatim quotes without interpretation.

**Session Structure:**
- 45-60 minute individual conversations
- Open-ended questions about identity, vision, operations
- No leading or suggesting language
- Audio recorded and transcribed

**Capture Protocol:**
- Every meaningful statement captured verbatim
- Speaker attribution maintained
- No paraphrasing or summarization
- Timestamp reference for verification

**Domain Coverage:**
1. What IS Voyj?
2. What should guests feel?
3. What role should technology play?
4. What are you building beyond transactions?
5. How does this grow?
6. Resource priorities
7. Success metrics
8. Team dynamics

### 2.2 Phase 2: Quote Corpus Development (Weeks 3-5)

**Objective:** Build searchable, analyzable database of all quotes.

**Corpus Structure:**
```
Quote ID | Speaker | Domain | Text | Conviction Level | Flags
```

**Conviction Levels:**
- **High:** Unprompted, emphatic, repeated
- **Medium:** Clear statement, single instance
- **Low:** Qualified, hedged, uncertain

**Flag System:**
- `pillar-candidate`: Language that could become foundational
- `shared-language`: Phrase used by multiple speakers
- `tension`: Contradicts another quote
- `deck-ready`: Suitable for presentation

**Quality Standards:**
- Quotes must be verbatim (not paraphrased)
- Minimum 10 words for context
- Speaker must be identifiable
- Domain must be tagged

### 2.3 Phase 3: Pattern Analysis (Weeks 4-6)

**Objective:** Surface consensus, tensions, and linguistic patterns.

**Analysis Methods:**

**Consensus Mapping:**
- For each topic, extract what each founder said
- Identify 4/4 alignment (explicit agreement)
- Identify 3/4 alignment (implicit patterns)
- Document evidence with quote IDs

**Tension Detection:**
- Compare quotes on same topics
- Flag contradictions (even within same speaker)
- Categorize: surface tension vs. fundamental divergence
- Prepare for facilitation (some tensions productive, some need resolution)

**Shared Language Identification:**
- Search for identical or near-identical phrases
- Map which words appear across multiple speakers
- Distinguish programmatic language (industry terms) from authentic language (operational specifics)

**Language Excavation Process:**
1. Identify "programmed word" (industry standard term everyone uses)
2. Extract what each founder says when describing the same concept
3. Find the "essence alternative" (more specific language underneath)
4. Test: Does the alternative capture meaning better than the shorthand?

### 2.4 Phase 4: Pillar Synthesis (Weeks 5-7)

**Objective:** Distill patterns into actionable decision-making framework.

**Synthesis Criteria:**
- Must have evidence from 3+ founders
- Must appear in operational (not aspirational) language
- Must be specific enough to guide decisions
- Must be defensible with verbatim quotes

**The Voyj Pillars (Result):**

| Pillar | Replaces | Definition | Evidence Base |
|--------|----------|------------|---------------|
| **Nucleus** | "Community" | The center that draws in and organizes everything around it | 4/4 founders, 47 quotes |
| **Considered** | "Elevated/Curated" | Decisions made with care, not at scale | 4/4 founders, 38 quotes |
| **Present** | "Personal" | On-site and attentive | 4/4 founders, 29 quotes |
| **Seen** | "Belonging" | Recognized, not processed | 3/4 founders explicit, 23 quotes |

### 2.5 Phase 5: Artifact Development (Weeks 6-8)

**Objective:** Create deliverables that make pillars operational.

Two artifacts emerged from the work:

1. **PowerPoint Deck** (34 slides): For team facilitation and alignment
2. **Interactive HTML Tool** (3,000+ lines): For ongoing decision-making

---

## Part 3: Artifact 1 - PowerPoint Deck

### 3.1 Purpose and Audience

**Purpose:** Facilitate team session where founders validate, refine, or replace proposed pillars.

**Audience:** Internal leadership team (4 founders + key stakeholders)

**Use Case:** Single presentation session with discussion breaks

### 3.2 Narrative Architecture

The deck follows a deliberate narrative arc:

```

### 3.3 Design System

**Typography:**
- Headlines: Sans-serif, bold, ALL CAPS for domain labels
- Body: Clean sans-serif, comfortable reading size
- Quotes: Distinct styling with speaker attribution

**Color Palette:**
- Primary: Deep maroon (#511313) - authority, hospitality
- Secondary: Dusty green (#515A35) - growth, organic
- Tertiary: Matcha (#849449) - freshness, presence
- Neutral: Warm gray (#807060) - groundedness
- Background: Cream/oat tones - warmth, approachability

**Layout Principles:**
- One idea per slide
- Quotes are primary content (not summaries)
- Speaker attribution always visible
- White space for breathing room
- Visual hierarchy guides eye movement

### 3.4 Key Design Decisions

**Decision: Lead with constraints (what Voyj is NOT)**
- Rationale: Identity work often fails by trying to define everything. Starting with rejections establishes boundaries.
- Evidence: Each founder had explicit "we're not X" statements.

**Decision: Show all four founders on domain slides**
- Rationale: Demonstrates alignment is real, not cherry-picked.
- Risk mitigated: Some domains had 3/4 coverage; noted in speaker notes.

**Decision: Present excavation as methodology, not conclusion**
- Rationale: Team owns the decision. We surface options; they choose.
- Implementation: "The facilitation question" asks which language is actually theirs.

**Decision: End with two specific decisions**
- Rationale: Strategic work must produce actionable outcomes.
- The two decisions: (1) Do these pillars reflect who you are? (2) What's the primary growth vector?

### 3.5 Speaker Notes Architecture

Every slide includes speaker notes with:
- Facilitation guidance
- Quote ID references for verification
- Anticipated questions
- Transition language

Example (Slide 33 - The Pillars):
```
THE PILLARS - Crescendo Moment

This slide is the culmination of all the excavation work. Present it as the arrival:

"After examining 689 quotes, identifying where you agree, where you diverge, 
and excavating the authentic language underneath the industry shorthand... 
these are your three pillars."

NUCLEUS (replaces "Community")
- Not just gathering people, but being the gravitational center
- The hotel becomes the heartbeat of the region

CONSIDERED (replaces "Elevated + Curated")
- Moves beyond buzzwords to operational reality
- Every decision made with intention, not scaled automation

SEEN (replaces "Belonging")
- The opposite of transactional
- Guests recognized as individuals, not room numbers

FACILITATION NOTE:
Pause here. Let this land. These three words will guide every future decision.
```

## Part 4: Artifact 2 - Interactive HTML Tool

### 4.1 Purpose and Audience

**Purpose:** Make pillars operational for daily decision-making.

**Audience:** Leadership team and future team members.

**Use Case:** Ongoing reference tool. When facing a decision, input it and see how it maps to pillars.

### 4.2 Technical Architecture

**Single-file HTML application** (no external dependencies except Google Fonts)

**Structure:**
```
HTML Document (3,000+ lines)
├── Head
│   ├── Comprehensive metadata (TUKU attribution, watermarks)
│   ├── Google Fonts (Inter, Instrument Serif)
│   └── Embedded CSS (~1,400 lines)
├── Body
│   ├── Navigation (sticky, scroll-aware)
│   ├── Hero Section
│   ├── Decision Filter Tool (interactive)
│   ├── Four Pillar Sections
│   │   ├── Nucleus
│   │   ├── Considered
│   │   ├── Present
│   │   └── Seen
│   ├── Close Section
│   └── Appendix (How to Use)
└── Script (~300 lines JavaScript)
```

### 4.3 The Decision Filter Tool

**Core Functionality:**
User inputs a decision or initiative. Tool analyzes text and returns:
- Which pillars are activated
- Strength of alignment (strong/moderate)
- Insight text explaining the connection
- Visual indicator of pillar coverage

**Keyword Architecture:**

Each pillar has a curated keyword list derived from founder language:

```javascript
const pillarKeywords = {
    nucleus: {
        strong: ['1880', 'hub', 'anchor', 'flagship', 'center', 'nucleus', 
                 'heartbeat', 'radiates', 'gravitational', 'central'],
        moderate: ['property', 'location', 'venue', 'destination', 'base', 
                   'expand', 'satellite', 'regional', 'local']
    },
    considered: {
        strong: ['vetted', 'curated', 'intentional', 'deliberate', 'chosen',
                 'selected', 'quality', 'standards', 'approval'],
        moderate: ['review', 'evaluate', 'assess', 'careful', 'thoughtful',
                   'premium', 'elevated', 'refined']
    },
    present: {
        strong: ['on-site', 'onsite', 'in-person', 'face-to-face', 'there',
                 'available', 'attentive', 'responsive', 'hands-on'],
        moderate: ['staff', 'team', 'hospitality', 'service', 'support',
                   'greeting', 'welcome', 'assistance']
    },
    seen: {
        strong: ['recognized', 'remembered', 'known', 'valued', 'appreciated',
                 'individual', 'personal', 'specific', 'unique'],
        moderate: ['guest', 'experience', 'feeling', 'impression', 'memory',
                   'connection', 'relationship', 'return']
    }
};
```

**Insight Generation:**

Each pillar has contextual insights that surface based on keyword matches:

```javascript
const pillarInsights = {
    nucleus: "This decision connects to your role as the gravitational center. 
              1880 as the heartbeat that everything radiates from.",
    considered: "This reflects the human hand in every decision. 
                 Vetted, intentional, not algorithmic.",
    present: "This aligns with being on-site and attentive. 
              The opposite of remote management.",
    seen: "This supports guests feeling recognized, not processed. 
           The opposite of transactional anonymity."
};
```

### 4.4 Pillar Section Design

Each of the four pillar sections follows identical structure:

```
PILLAR SECTION
├── Header Row
│   ├── Left: Title + Statement
│   └── Right: Founder Quote (aligned bottom)
├── Capabilities Grid (4 cards)
│   └── Each card: Icon + Title + Description
├── Decision Test Bar
│   └── Full-width: Question + "If yes, this is [Pillar]"
└── Current Work Table
    └── Initiative | Status | Connection to Pillar
```

**Design Rationale:**
- Header establishes identity with founder voice
- Capabilities translate pillar into operational behaviors
- Decision Test provides quick self-assessment
- Current Work shows pillar already in action

### 4.5 Visual Design System

**Color System (CSS Variables):**
```css
:root {
    --maroon: #511313;      /* Nucleus pillar */
    --dusty-green: #515A35; /* Considered pillar */
    --matcha: #849449;      /* Present pillar */
    --cream: #F8F2E6;       /* Background */
    --sage: #C4CBA4;        /* Accent */
    --warm-gray: #807060;   /* Seen pillar */
    --oat: #F0E1CA;         /* Secondary background */
}
```

**Typography:**
- Headlines: Instrument Serif (editorial, warm)
- Body: Inter (clean, readable)
- Size scale: 11px (labels) → 56px (pillar titles)

**Spacing System:**
- Section padding: 120px vertical
- Content max-width: 1200px
- Card grid gap: 24px
- Consistent breathing room throughout

### 4.6 Responsive Behavior

**Breakpoints:**
- Desktop: Full grid layouts, side-by-side content
- Tablet (768px): Adjusted grids, maintained hierarchy
- Mobile: Stacked layouts, touch-friendly spacing

**Key Responsive Adaptations:**
- Navigation collapses to minimal
- Pillar headers stack vertically
- Decision filter maintains usability
- Tables scroll horizontally if needed

### 4.7 Metadata and Watermarking

**Head Metadata:**

## Part 5: Best Practices for Replication

### 5.1 Pre-Engagement Requirements

**Client Readiness:**
- [ ] Multiple stakeholders available for individual sessions
- [ ] Willingness to have conversations recorded/transcribed
- [ ] Existing operations to reference (not pure startup)
- [ ] Strategic decision pending that pillars could inform

**TUKU Preparation:**
- [ ] Session question framework prepared
- [ ] Quote corpus database structure ready
- [ ] Domain categories drafted (expect to modify)
- [ ] Recording/transcription workflow confirmed

### 5.2 Session Execution Standards

**Do:**
- Ask open-ended questions
- Let silences breathe (founders fill them with real thinking)
- Capture exact language, including verbal tics
- Note energy shifts and conviction levels
- Ask "what do you mean by [industry term]?"

**Don't:**
- Suggest language or complete their sentences
- Rush to the next question
- Paraphrase in real-time
- Lead with frameworks
- Judge contradictions in the moment

### 5.3 Analysis Standards

**Quote Corpus Quality:**
- Minimum 50 quotes per founder for meaningful patterns
- Every quote must be traceable to source
- Conviction levels must be defensible
- Flags must be consistently applied

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Shared language requires 2+ founders using identical/near-identical phrase
- Consensus requires evidence from all participating founders
- Tensions must be documented with competing quote IDs
- Excavation requires programmed word AND operational alternatives

### 5.4 Artifact Development Standards

**PowerPoint Deck:**
- One idea per slide
- Quotes are primary content
- Speaker notes enable facilitation by anyone
- Design system must feel like the client (not generic TUKU)
- End with specific decisions, not open-ended discussion

**Interactive Tool:**
- Single-file HTML (no dependencies that could break)
- Keyword lists derived from actual founder language
- Decision filter must be immediately useful
- Visual design extends deck aesthetic
- Comprehensive metadata/watermarking

### 5.5 Quality Checklist

**Before Delivery:**
- [ ] Every pillar has 20+ supporting quotes
- [ ] Every excavation shows 3+ founder perspectives
- [ ] Tensions are surfaced, not hidden
- [ ] Decision filter tested with real scenarios
- [ ] Speaker notes complete for all slides
- [ ] Metadata and watermarks in place
- [ ] Client name/context accurate throughout
- [ ] No orphaned references or placeholder text

## Part 6: Templates and Frameworks

### 6.1 Quote Corpus Schema

```
| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| quote_id | Integer | Unique identifier |
| speaker | String | Founder name |
| session_id | Integer | Reference to session |

```

### 6.2 Language Excavation Template

```markdown
## THE PROGRAMMED WORD: [Term]

**Usage:** [X/4] founders use this word

**When describing the same concept, each founder uses different language:**

### [FOUNDER 1]
> "[Verbatim quote showing their operational language]"

### [FOUNDER 2]  
> "[Verbatim quote showing their operational language]"

### [FOUNDER 3]
> "[Verbatim quote showing their operational language]"

### [FOUNDER 4]
> "[Verbatim quote showing their operational language]"

---

## THE ESSENCE ALTERNATIVE: [New Term]

**Definition:** "[One-line definition]"

**Why it works:** [2-3 sentences explaining why this captures meaning better than the industry term]
```

### 6.3 Pillar Definition Template

```markdown
## [PILLAR NAME]

**Replaces:** [Industry term it excavates from]

**Definition:** [One sentence, operational]

**The Test:** [Question format - "Does this [verb] our [pillar]?"]

**Evidence Base:**
- Founders with explicit evidence: [X/4]
- Total supporting quotes: [N]
- Key quote IDs: [list]

**Capabilities (What This Enables):**
1. [Capability 1]: [Description]
2. [Capability 2]: [Description]
3. [Capability 3]: [Description]
4. [Capability 4]: [Description]

**Decision Filter Keywords:**
- Strong signals: [list]
- Moderate signals: [list]

**Current Work Examples:**
| Initiative | Status | Connection |
|------------|--------|------------|
| [Example] | [Status] | [How it expresses pillar] |
```

### 6.4 Tension Documentation Template

```markdown
## TENSION: [Name]

**Domain:** [Where this surfaced]

**The Conflict:**

### Position A: [Label]
**Held by:** [Founder names]
> "[Supporting quote]"
> "[Supporting quote]"

### Position B: [Label]
**Held by:** [Founder names]
> "[Supporting quote]"
> "[Supporting quote]"

**Status:** [ ] Unresolved  [ ] Acknowledged  [ ] Resolved

**Facilitation Note:** [How to surface this productively in team session]

**Resolution Path:** [What decision or conversation would resolve this]
```

## Part 7: Lessons Learned

### 7.1 What Worked Exceptionally Well

**Language Excavation as methodology:**
- Founders immediately recognized their own language
- Industry terms created false consensus; excavation revealed true alignment
- "Nucleus" resonated more than "community" because it was already their word

**Quote corpus as authority:**
- Every claim backed by evidence
- Founders couldn't dispute their own words
- 689 quotes created undeniable pattern recognition

**Two-artifact approach:**
- Deck for alignment moment (one-time)
- Tool for ongoing use (persistent value)
- Different formats for different purposes

### 7.2 What We'd Refine

**Session scheduling:**
- Individual sessions before any group sessions
- Group dynamics can suppress authentic language
- Some founders more verbose; adjust session length accordingly

**Tension surfacing:**
- Earlier identification allows more preparation
- Some tensions are productive (keep); some need resolution (facilitate)
- Don't hide tensions to maintain false harmony

**Tool keyword calibration:**
- Initial keyword lists need testing with real decisions
- Founder review of keywords adds legitimacy
- Plan for keyword expansion as organization evolves

### 7.3 Replication Considerations

**Time Investment:**
- Minimum 6 weeks for quality work
- Session transcription adds 2-3 days per session
- Analysis phase cannot be rushed

**Client Participation:**
- Requires significant founder time (3-4 hours per person minimum)
- Team facilitation session requires full attendance
- Ongoing tool use requires champion

**Deliverable Customization:**
- Color palette must reflect client identity
- Keyword lists must use client's actual language
- Examples must be real initiatives, not hypotheticals
