# TUKU Client Work Voice Guide

**Purpose:** Quick reference for voice and tone when producing client deliverables
**Version:** 1.0
**Updated:** December 2025

## Core Principle

**"Demonstrate, Don't Declare"**

Show capability through the work itself. Don't claim it in the copy.

The deliverable IS the proof of capability. You don't explain why you're good, you show it through precision, specificity, and craft.

---

## Voice Standards

### Do

- Declarative statements
- Lead with outcomes
- Specific numbers ("400 pages, 20,088 lines, 4.5:1 ratio")
- Present-tense, forward-looking
- Calm facts
- Let artifact demonstrate

### Don't

- Explain process ("I did this, then...")
- Lead with methodology
- Vague claims ("comprehensive", "robust")
- Defensive positioning ("The surprise isn't...")
- Sales-heavy language
- Over-explain how it was made

---

## Attribution Pattern

**Agency as actor:**
- "TUKU produced [X]"
- "TUKU developed [X]"

**Client as subject:**
- "[CLIENT] needed [X]"
- "[CLIENT] required [X]"

**Never:** "[CLIENT] produced..." (wrong attribution)

---

## Template Phrases

Use these patterns:

- "What was needed. What emerged."
- "Not a prototype. Not an MVP."
- "Documentation that enables rather than constrains"
- "The difference: [KEY INSIGHT]"
- "We questioned whether [X] was serving the outcome"
- "TUKU produced [NUMBER]"

---

## Forbidden Patterns

- "What it took:" process lists
- "The surprise isn't..." (defensive framing)
- "I did X, Claude did Y" (process narration)
- Em dashes in copy
- Over-explaining AI mechanics
- "We follow industry best practices"
- "Here's our process (like everyone's)"
- "This is how it's always done"

---

## The Decision Filter

Before any client deliverable, ask:

> "Does this prove our thinking or just claim it?"

- **If it claims** → Rewrite to demonstrate
- **If it proves** → Ship

---

## Language Shortcuts

### Say This

- "We questioned whether [X] was serving the outcome"
- "We built what should exist"
- "The structure emerged from the work"
- "This demonstrates [principle] through practice"
- "What if we approached this differently?"

### Not This

- "We follow industry best practices"
- "Here's our process (like everyone's)"
- "This is how it's always done"
- "We're different just because"
- "We optimize [standard metric]"

---

## Underlying Philosophy

Traditional work *describes*. TUKU work *demonstrates*.

Case studies show screenshots. We build generative art that proves computational capability.

Proposals explain methodology. We deliver artifacts that embody the methodology.

The work speaks. You don't explain why you're good.
