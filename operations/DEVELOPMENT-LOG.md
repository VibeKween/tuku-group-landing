## Final Copy Implementation

### Streamlined Content Flow:
- **Hero**: "Assembled with intention" (softer than "built")
- **About**: Concise "creative house for ventures that matter"
- **Approach**: "We hold what we believe in" (removed parent/child language)
- **Work**: Focus on "emerging labels" (variety from "small brands")
- **Contact**: Branded email subject "Start a conversation — Tuku Group"
- **Footer**: Updated to "© 2025 Tuku Group, LLC"

### Typography & Design:
- **Single font**: JetBrains Mono throughout
- **Ultra-minimal**: Pure text blocks with massive whitespace
- **600px max-width**: Centered, single-column layout
- **Sequential flow**: Each concept in its own section
- **Brand gold accent**: Philosophy headers in #C19A4B for emphasis

---

## Design Implementation

### Typography
- **Headers**: Space Grotesk (fallback for ITC Avant Garde Gothic)
- **Body**: Lekton monospace font
- **Scaling**: Responsive from mobile (16px base) to desktop (18px base)
- **Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between hero, section, and body text

### Layout Approach
- **Minimal**: Ultra-clean with abundant whitespace
- **Manifesto-driven**: Each section focuses on single concept
- **Mobile-first**: Responsive grid system
- **Type-forward**: Typography as primary visual element

### Color Usage
- **Black sections**: About and Work (alternating contrast)
- **White sections**: Hero, Philosophy, Engage
- **Gold accent**: Contact links and selection highlights

---

## Next Steps Available

### Immediate Optimizations
- [ ] Add custom ITC Avant Garde Gothic font files
- [ ] Implement smooth scroll animations
- [ ] Add subtle hover states and micro-interactions
- [ ] Optimize loading performance

### Content Refinements

- [ ] Implement contact form (if email links insufficient)

### Technical Enhancements
- [ ] Add favicon and meta tags for social sharing
- [ ] Implement Google Analytics or privacy-focused analytics
- [ ] Add structured data for SEO
- [ ] Set up deployment pipeline

## [October 7, 2025] Session Archive: SEO Enhancement & CTA Redesign

**STATUS**: DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION - SEO optimizations and CTA improvements live

**SESSION OVERVIEW**:
- Copy deck validation against live site content
- Comprehensive SEO enhancement across all pages
- Homepage CTA redesign with improved hierarchy
- Local copy deck filing for future reference

**MAJOR ACCOMPLISHMENTS**:

**1. SEO OPTIMIZATION**:
- Added comprehensive metadata to `/approach.html` (Twitter Cards, structured data, breadcrumbs)
- Enhanced `/fewer-better-slower/index.html` with complete SEO package (previously missing)
- Implemented service offers schema and canonical URLs site-wide
- Added Open Graph tags for social media sharing optimization

**2. HOMEPAGE CTA REDESIGN**:
- Moved from side-by-side CTAs to integrated inline approach
- Primary CTA: "Start a conversation" button (solid blue #4a7ba7)
- Secondary CTA: "Learn about our approach" inline link within sentence flow
- Enhanced visual hierarchy and improved user experience

**3. COPY MANAGEMENT**:
- Validated `/Users/falonbahal/Downloads/TUKU_Group_Final_Copy.md` against live site
- Filed copy deck locally at `/docs/TUKU_Group_Final_Copy.md` for reference
- Confirmed homepage and approach page copy alignment
- Verified fewer-better-slower page content structure

**4. FILE STRUCTURE UPDATES**:
- Updated CSS cache buster to v=1.9 across all pages
- Maintained dual directory deployment (website/ → root)
- All changes committed and pushed to production

**UNRESOLVED TECHNICAL ISSUE**:

**Double Underline Problem on Inline Links**:
- **Issue**: "Learn about our approach" link showing double underlines despite CSS fixes
- **Location**: Homepage inline link within sentence: "We bring our beliefs to form - working with individuals whose practice reflects care and clarity. Learn about our approach."
- **CSS Attempts**: 
  - Added `.inline-link` class with `text-decoration: none` and `border-bottom` approach
  - Applied `!important` declarations
  - Updated cache busters
  - Removed conflicting text-decoration properties
- **Browser Behavior**: Works correctly on `localhost:9000` but not on `127.0.0.1:9000`
- **User Note**: SIGNALS hyperlinking worked fine previously; unclear why this implementation differs

**TROUBLESHOOTING CONTEXT FOR NEXT SESSION**:
The double underline issue persists despite multiple CSS approaches. Key investigation points:
1. Compare current implementation with working SIGNALS link structure
2. Investigate CSS inheritance conflicts between `.inline-link` and base `a` styles
3. Examine why browser caching differs between localhost and 127.0.0.1
4. Review CSS specificity and cascade order for link styling

**DEPLOYED CHANGES**:
- All SEO enhancements live in production
- Homepage CTA redesign deployed and functional
- Copy deck filed locally for future reference
- Button styling fixed (solid blue background working correctly)

**PROJECT STATUS**: Production deployment successful with pending CSS troubleshooting for next session
